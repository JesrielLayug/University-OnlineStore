Welcome to my Online University E-commerce Web Application! ðŸŽ“ðŸ›’

## Overview
My project is a comprehensive web application designed to cater to the unique needs of an online university's e-commerce platform. We've developed a feature-rich solution that offers both a seamless shopping experience and robust administrative control.

## Key Features

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** Our application includes a secure authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access its features. User roles are defined to manage permissions effectively.

2. **Admin Hierarchy:** We've implemented a hierarchical admin structure, starting with the head admin who possesses the authority to add or delete other admins. Admins, in turn, have the ability to monitor all users.

3. **Admin-Campus Assignment:** Each admin is responsible for their assigned campus. This feature ensures that administrative tasks and oversight are tailored to specific university campuses, enhancing efficiency and accountability.

4. **Dashboard:** The application boasts a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of critical information, user activity, and sales analytics. This feature empowers admins to make informed decisions.

5. **CRUD Product Management:** We've incorporated full-fledged product management capabilities, allowing admins to Create, Read, Update, and Delete products seamlessly. This feature ensures that the product catalog stays up-to-date.

6. **Complete E-commerce Features:** Our platform encompasses all the essential e-commerce features, including:
   - Product Catalog: Browse and explore a diverse range of university-related products.
   - User Cart: Add products to the cart, review selections, and proceed to checkout.
   - Order Management: Place and track orders conveniently.
   - User Profiles: Manage user profiles and track order history.
   - Secure Payment: Ensure safe and secure online transactions.
